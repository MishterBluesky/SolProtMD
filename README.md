# SolProtMD
Inspired by MemProtMD, prepares coarse grain simulations in solution.

## **SolProtMD** - Coarse grain molecular dynamics preparation for soluble proteins.

Solution former allows you to create the input files including .gro, the box with water and salt and the topol.top file for the uploaded proteins of choice to be simulated by coarse grain molecular dynamics in the GROMACS simulation software. Simply choose the NaCl concentration (in Molar) and upload your pdb file. The default is 500ns, but you may edit the .mdp file. This relies on martini3 forcefields.
